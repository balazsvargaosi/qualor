/**
 * Safe GitLab Markdown for comments (scm.md §6). Every value that did not come from Qualor's own
 * code goes through {@link codeSpan}: inside a code span GitLab renders no Markdown, HTML, image,
 * link, autolink, emoji, reference (`#1`, `!2`) or mention (`@all`), and a value that can never
 * contain a line break never starts a line, where GitLab would run a quick action (`/merge`).
 *
 * The guarantee, tested by the adversarial corpus of `render.test.ts`:
 * - a value is one line: every C0/C1 control (LF, CR, NEL, VT, FF, NUL...), U+2028/U+2029 and
 *   every bidirectional control becomes a space, so it can neither start a line nor reorder
 *   what a reviewer reads;
 * - invisible format characters (zero-width space, word joiner, BOM, soft hyphen, tag
 *   characters...) and blank-looking fillers (Hangul fillers, the braille blank) are removed and
 *   lone surrogates become U+FFFD; ZWJ, ZWNJ and variation selectors stay, so emoji sequences and
 *   scripts that need them render whole;
 * - it is cut to its bound in code points (never inside a grapheme when a whole one fits)
 *   before the fence is chosen, so the fence is at most bound + 1 backticks;
 * - the fence is one backtick longer than the longest run inside and padded with a space, so
 *   the value cannot close the span;
 * - bodies are shortened only at whole lines ({@link linesWithinBytes}), so no span is cut open;
 * - links are Qualor's own http(s) URLs and rules' https documentation links only
 *   ({@link qualorLink}, {@link ruleKeyMarkdown}), with the characters that could end or break a
 *   link destination percent-encoded.
 *
 * The AI review's words are the exception that reads as prose, not as a value in a code span: a
 * model's sentences are posted as text through {@link safeProse}, which keeps ordinary words plain
 * and puts every other word in a code span, so nothing it writes is more than a word to GitLab and
 * GitHub either. In a fenced block, which renders none of it, they are cleaned the same way and
 * written as they are ({@link plainProse}).
