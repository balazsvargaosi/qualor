/*
 * The `ai-reply` job's answer to a command row (6I-4): `qualor review`, `qualor fix` or
 * `qualor stop`, the first words of a note of a merge request, which decoration (or a webhook's
 * scan) wrote as a row of the replies ledger with its job (reply-queue.ts). The row is taken as a
 * reply's is (reply-job.ts) and makes no model call, and asks no budget. The merge request is read,
 * and one that is merged or closed ends the row `skipped: closed`, with no run made and no answer;
 * the command's own note is read too (a GitLab command's discussion, a GitHub command's comment),
 * and one that is gone ends it `skipped: thread_gone`. For a `qualor review` with no decision yet,
 * one more request asks the provider whether the author of that note has the rights a reply needs
 * to change a status (a review costs tokens). Then `handleCommand` (commands.ts) decides, in one
 * transaction that also makes or restarts the run, and stores the fixed text of the answer on the
 * row, so that a retry never decides twice nor asks for the rights again. The answer is posted
 * once, beside the command's note (a note of Qualor's whose first line names the row is the answer
 * a post stored though its outcome was lost), and the row ends `done` with the decision's outcome:
 * a refusal is `not_available`. AI review being off does not skip a command: it is answered so. A
 * branch with no newest analysis ends the row `failed: internal`, with no answer. A row that has
 * its answer note ends `done` with its outcome at once, with no request: what became of the merge
 * request or of the command's note since changes nothing of an answer that was given.
 *
 * The requests pass the connection's circuit in two goes (reply-steps.ts): the merge request and
 * the command's discussion before the decision, and the post after it, so that a row that waits for
 * the circuit before its decision has made no run.
