/*
 * The `ai-reply` jobs (6I-4): Qualor's answer to a round of people's replies in one of its
 * threads, or to a person's command, which decoration (or a webhook's scan) wrote as a row of the
 * replies ledger with its job (reply-queue.ts). The job takes the row (a row queued longer ago than
 * the reply window, which waited that long for a failing SCM connection or model provider, ends
 * `skipped: expired`) and then, for a reply, in this order, each step written on the row, or found
 * again where it was done, so that a retry resumes after the last one:
 * 1. AI review no longer active for the project ends the row `skipped: inactive`;
 * 2. with no decision yet, a day with no tokens left for it ends it `skipped: budget_spent`, and a
 *    newer round of its thread that was answered, posted its answer, or holds a decision and is
 *    alive (that round read this row's notes too: `coveredByNewer`) `skipped: superseded`, before
 *    anything is read or sent;
 * 3. the merge request is read, as the review job reads it: merged or closed ends the row
 *    `skipped: closed`. The thread is read again through the job's own client: one that is gone
 *    ends it `skipped: thread_gone`, and so does one that someone resolved before Qualor answered,
 *    unless the row already changed the status;
 * 4. with no decision yet, the model decides (reply-engine.ts) over the people's notes of the round,
 *    with the rights in the SCM of those who wrote them, and the decision is stored: the model is
 *    never asked twice for one row. A row put back in the queue runs behind the jobs queued before
 *    it, so a row that has neither changed the status nor posted its answer is then skipped as
 *    superseded, its decision dropped, when a newer round covers it meanwhile (as in 2). A row
 *    that has done either finishes, whatever newer rows did: its effect happened, and its answer
 *    says so;
 * 5. a verdict that is not `keep` changes the status of the thread's open AI finding, as the
 *    system's change (transitions.ts), recorded on the row with it, so that it is made once. It is
 *    never made once the answer is posted (the answer said what the reply changed), and always
 *    before the thread is resolved: decoration reopens a thread Qualor resolved while its finding is
 *    open;
 * 6. the answer is posted once: a note of Qualor's in the thread whose first line names the row is
 *    the answer a post stored though its outcome was lost, and is not posted again;
 * 7. a verdict that is not `keep` resolves the thread;
 * 8. the row ends `done`, with what came of it.
 * The row's issue must be its project's, before the decision and before the thread is acted on (a
 * monorepo's thread of another project's issue never is): otherwise the row ends `failed: internal`.
 *
 * A command row (`qualor review`, `qualor fix`, `qualor stop`) is taken in the same way and makes
 * no model call, and asks no budget: reply-commands.ts answers it.
 *
 * The job's own requests pass the connection's circuit as the `scm` worker's jobs do (scm.md
 * §4.2), in two goes, so that no probe of it waits on the model: the merge request, the thread and
 * the round's rights (3 and 4) before the model is asked, and the status change, the post and the
 * resolution (5 to 7) after it; for a command, the merge request and its discussion before the
 * decision, and the post after it. A circuit that is open, or half-open with another job's probe in
 * flight, puts the row back in the queue for when it lets a job through, with no try spent and
 * nothing changed by that go; the circuit hears what came of the requests it let through. The
 * model provider's circuit, which the calls of the model pass (usage.ts), does the same for a row
 * the model has yet to decide: asked right after the day's budget, before any request to GitLab
 * or GitHub or any masking, it puts the row back unless it would let the job through (closed, or
 * half-open with this job as its probe), and a call it refuses later does the same, with nothing
 * decided. The organisation's slots are the decorations': the job takes none.
 *
 * A stop of the server while the model decides puts the row back in the queue for the next server;
 * AI review switched off meanwhile ends it `skipped: inactive`. Any other error fails the job into
 * its second try, which resumes; a row left running after both is the sweep's (reply-queue.ts).
 * Nothing the people or the model wrote is ever logged: the row's id, codes and counts only.
