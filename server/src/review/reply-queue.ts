 * (replies.ts) for each note that is new to the project, and the `ai-reply` job that answers it,
 * which the review worker runs beside the reviews (reply-job.ts). Nothing else writes these rows
 * and jobs (the job's own stop, and its wait for an SCM circuit, queue its row again here too), so
 * a row is queued exactly when its job is, and the sweep below ends a row its job left running.
 *
 * The other `ai-reply` job, a scan, is a webhook's: it names a merge request and reads its notes
 * through the API (reply-scan.ts), never trusting what the webhook carried. `queueScan` queues it,
 * one at a time for a merge request, and what a scan finds is queued as a decoration's notes are.
 *
 * A pass is bounded: at most 50 rounds and 20 commands, new ones and notes queued again together,
 * the oldest first, and the rest wait for the next pass. The caps count only what the ledger does
 * not hold already: detection hands over every command in the window each time, and a note that
 * was queued takes no place of the cap that a note nobody queued yet could have.
