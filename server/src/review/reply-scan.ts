/*
 * The `ai-reply` job's scan (6I-4): the job a webhook queues for a merge request (routes/
 * gitlab-webhooks.ts), so that a reply in one of Qualor's threads, or a command, is answered at
 * once rather than at the next decoration. The webhook names a merge request and nothing else: the
 * scan reads its notes through the API, with a client of its own and its own request budget, and
 * queues what it finds as a decoration queues the notes it read (reply-queue.ts: the same
 * detection, the same ledger, so a note found by both is answered once).
 *
 * It does nothing for a branch that is not a merge request's, or one whose project has no AI
 * review active (the same window as decoration's), and nothing more for a merge request that is
 * merged or closed, which is read first, as the answer job reads it, through no organisation slot.
 * The requests pass the connection's circuit as the answer job's do (reply-steps.ts): a circuit
 * that does not let them through queues the scan again for when it reopens, with no try spent. A
 * merge request the provider no longer has ends the scan at info level, with the branch and none of
 * the provider's words. Any other error fails the job into its second try; after that, a later scan
 * or decoration finds the same notes. Nothing a person wrote is read here or logged: the job
 * reads the notes and hands them to the queue, which keeps only the ids and the author's name.
