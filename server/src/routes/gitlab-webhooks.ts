/*
 * GitLab's webhook (6I-4): a note on a merge request queues a scan of that merge request's notes
 * (review/reply-scan.ts), so that a reply in one of Qualor's threads, or a `qualor review`, is
 * answered at once rather than at the next analysis. The payload is only a pointer: the merge
 * request it names is the one scanned, and the note's text, its author and its id are never read.
 * The scan reads the notes through the API.
 *
 * GitLab counts any 4xx or 5xx answer, and a timeout, as a failure of the delivery: it backs off
 * a hook that fails four times in a row, and disables it for good after forty. So every delivery
 * GitLab really made is answered 204, whatever Qualor makes of it: an event it does not read, a
 * project or a merge request it does not know, a project without AI review, a payload it does not
 * understand. An error is for a caller that is not GitLab (a wrong token, an unknown connection),
 * for a body that is no JSON, and for Qualor's own failure.
